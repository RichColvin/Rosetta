<h1>Rosetta System</h1>
<p>The Rosetta system is an implementation of <a href="https://www.linuxcnc.org" target="new">LinuxCNC</a> on a hardware platform which is a combination of both off-the-shelf and custom-developed parts.

Thusly, if you encounter issues, please contact us and we will endeavour to remediate your system's problems.</p>

<p>Use of the Rosetta system is covered by these terms of use.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Colvin Tools may seek injunctive relief, specific performance, and/or other equitable relief in any court worldwide that has competent jurisdiction.

<h2>18. GENERAL</h2>

<p>18.1. Entire Agreement. This Agreement represents the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces any and all prior and contemporaneous oral or written understandings and statements by the parties with respect to such subject matter.

<p>18.2. Assignment. Colvin Tools may assign this Agreement (or any of its rights and obligations hereunder) without your consent and without notice. This Agreement is personal to you, and you shall not assign this Agreement (or any of its obligations or rights hereunder) without Colvin Tools&rsquo; prior express written consent in a duly signed writing. Any prohibited assignment shall be null and void.

<p style="margin-bottom:0; ">18.3. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, then: 
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-left: 33pt;">(a) the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; and 
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-left: 33pt;">(b) such affected provision shall be ineffective solely as to such jurisdiction (and only to the extent and for the duration of such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability), and shall be substituted (in respect of such jurisdiction) with a valid, legal, and enforceable provision that most closely approximates the original legal intent and economic impact of such provision.

<p>18.4. Remedies. Except as stated otherwise in this Agreement, no right or remedy conferred upon or reserved by any party under this Agreement is intended to be, or shall be deemed, exclusive of any other right or remedy under this Agreement, at law or in equity, but shall be cumulative of such other rights and remedies.

<p>18.5. Waiver. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. Any waiver granted hereunder must be in writing (for waivers by you, emails will be acceptable; for waivers by Colvin Tools, the writing must be duly signed by Colvin Tools), and shall be valid only in the specific instance in which given.

<p>18.6. Relationship. The relationship of the parties is solely that of independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create any employment, fiduciary, joint venture, agency or other relationship between the parties.

<p>18.7. Notices. You agree that Colvin Tools may send you notices by email, by regular mail, and/or via postings on the Site. Except as stated otherwise in this Agreement or required by Law applicable to you, you agrees to send all notices to Colvin Tools, to ColvinTools@Gmail.com.

<p>18.8. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement (for example, Colvin Tools Affiliates and Indemnitees), there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. You further acknowledge and agree that some of Colvin Tools&rsquo; suppliers and/or licensors may, in their agreements with Colvin Tools, be entitled to enforce certain rights and usage restrictions against users of the Site and Site Materials, and, to that extent, such suppliers and licensors shall have the right to enforce such rights and restrictions directly against you.

<p>18.9. Legal Compliance. You agree to use the Site and the Site Materials in compliance with all Laws applicable to you. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, you must not use or otherwise export or re-export any Site or Site Materials except as authorized by Export Control Laws. &ldquo;Export Control Laws&rdquo; means all export and re-export control Laws applicable to you, as well as the United States&rsquo; Export Administration Regulations (EAR) maintained by the US Department of Commerce, trade and economic sanctions maintained by the US Treasury Department&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) maintained by the US Department of State.

<p style="margin-bottom:0; ">18.10. Force Majeure. Colvin Tools shall not be responsible for any failure to perform any obligation or provide any service hereunder because of any 
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-left: 33pt;">(a) act of God, 
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-left: 33pt;">(b) war, riot or civil commotion, 
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-left: 33pt;">(c) governmental acts or directives, strikes, work stoppage, or equipment or facilities shortages, and/or 
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-left: 33pt;">(d) other similar cause beyond Colvin Tools&rsquo; reasonable control. 
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">For the avoidance of doubt, any problems relating to the hosting of the Site or Site Materials shall not be deemed within Colvin Tools&rsquo; reasonable control.

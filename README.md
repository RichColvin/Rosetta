<img src="https://rosetta.colvintools.com/Images/Rosetta%20Logo%20-%20GitHub%20Library.png" width="300">
The Rosetta system is designed to provide the ornamental turner a way for linking activities using synchronisation of stepper motors, and assist the ornamantal turner with automating onerous tasks.

This project is to develop a standardized approach for the use of LinuxCNC to automate repetitive tasks on a rose engine.
